# System Setup
This Section of the repository is to facilitate configure the enviroment variables. The app is very limited. The template is based off the setup app.

The app needs a file tree like
```
|
|- glm\glm.hpp
|- glew\$(Config)\glew.lib
|
```
etc...

the libraries  provided in the releases are tailored for the setup app.

the template is a basic outline for any project and is very generic.
