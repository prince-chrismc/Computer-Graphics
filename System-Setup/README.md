# System Setup
This Section of the repository is to facilitate configure the enviroment variables. The app is very limited in terms of functionality. The app is looking for a file tree like [this](#file-tree-example); however the testing is only a single base file for each module. The [`Libraries.zip`](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/Computer-Graphics/releases/download/Setup-v1.1.0/Libraries.zip) pacakge provided in the releases is tailored for the setup app. The template is a basic outline for any project and is very generic but is built using the enviroment variables set by the setup.

### File Tree Example
```
|
|- glm\glm.hpp                // headers
|- glew\$(Config)\glew.lib    // .libs
|- 
```
